This is a Mini Calculator Project. It was self-made with HTML, CSS and Javascript with guidance from the Odin's Project.

It enables calculation with both the button on-screen and keyboard keys. Here the delete Keyboard button ('AC') clears the calculator display while the backspace keyboard ('DEL') button deletes the last inputted value on the calculator display.

It only conduct single expression calculations and is very easy to use.

The design for the calculator is a combination of detailed UI research and personal inspiration.

Enjoy!!
